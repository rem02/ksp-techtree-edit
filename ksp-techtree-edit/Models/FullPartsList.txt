 fairingSize1= AE-FF1 Airstream Protective Shell (1.25m)= While the Kerbals at Mission Control were still figuring out how to get their rockets back down to Kerbin safely, the research engineers at FLOOYD were quickly realising that protecting parts on ascent was just as important. Heavy research into two-dimensional-input driven procedural construction was then funded with the hopes of making protective shells for important payloads and interstage areas of the crafts. The protective shells also have the benefit of making the craft more aerodynamic, hopefully saving on precious rocket fuel! The AE-FF1 is the smallest size available from FLOOYD.

 fairingSize2= AE-FF2 Airstream Protective Shell (2.5m)= While the Kerbals at Mission Control were still figuring out how to get their rockets back down to Kerbin safely, the research engineers at FLOOYD were quickly realising that protecting parts on ascent was just as important.

 R8winglet= AV-R8 Winglet= The R8 Active Control Winglet series marked the debut of Kerlington Model Rockets in the Spacecraft engineering world. These winglets are equipped with movable pivots, which allow them to swivel and act as control surfaces. This feature was considered a huge advancement in control technology and most agree that it made Kerlington staff and R8 fans simply unbearable to be around.

 winglet= AV-T1 Winglet= Nothing is really known about this thing. Use it at your own risk.

 winglet3= Delta-Deluxe Winglet= The Delta-Deluxe Winglet is a large aerodynamic surface with a small built-in aileron. It is very lightweight and offers more lift than the AV-R8 but the small control surface area means it is not as quick to turn.

 wingConnector= Wing Connector Type A= A vaguely wing shaped board. Use at your own risk.

The "Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large" addresses that issue by its use of patented Large FlywheelsT to provide "More Torque" (patent pending). STEADLER promptly dismissed all criticism concerning the necessity of so much research work, stating that 'it only sounds so simple now that we've figured it out'. Critics remain skeptical, but none can disagree that this module does indeed pack a lot more punch than previous models. It also needs a lot more power, but STEADLER is currently carrying out intense research work on why that is.

 cupola= PPD-12 Cupola Module= The PPD-12 was developed to provide a high visibility control room for orbital stations, and a place for thoughtful Kerbals to contemplate the beauty of the cosmos.

 seatExternalCmd= EAS-1 External Command Seat= The EAS-1 External Command Seat provides all the controls needed to fully operate a spacecraft, just like a command pod, but without such needless frivolities as "pressurized interiors", or "seat belts". It's bare-bones, pedal-to-the-metal efficiency at its finest.

 crewCabin= PPD-10 Hitchhiker Storage Container= The HSC was an invention of necessity - how do we store 4 Kerbals on-orbit without any real provisions for return? Who needed this remains a mystery, as do his motivations.

 advSasModule= Advanced Inline Stabilizer= The Advanced Inline Stabilizer module containing a larger, heavier array of reaction wheels. These spin very quickly to create torque without wasting propellant. These larger wheels are driven by proportionally larger electric motors, so keep an eye on your Electricity levels.

 mk2Cockpit_Inline= Mk2 Inline Cockpit= After 'accidentally' snapping the nose off of the Mk2 Cockpit, the engineers over at the C7 Aerospace Division realised that such a design looked quite functional. They quickly hammered out the following part and spruced it up for all your inline spaceplane cockpit needs!

 mk2Cockpit_Standard= Mk2 Cockpit= Fits not one, but two Kerbals! This spearhead-shaped new Mk2 design from the lovable folks over at the C7 Aerospace Division should help you pierce the great blue yonder known as the Sky.

 mk2DroneCore= MK2 Drone Core= After extensive research and testing to improve the safety factor of next-generation modules for their Mk2 series, engineers at C7 Aerospace got fed up with having to constantly find new recruits willing to test their prototypes, and decided to develop an autonomous AI capable of doing the same job, only with a lot less screaming over the comms link. This was met with divided opinions, some criticizing C7 as taking the "booooring" route, others praising them for the innovation, while yet others reacted by shutting themselves in bunkers in anticipation of the time when these units will gain sentience and turn on their creators. C7 has vehemently denied any involvement in all sentient-AI-related catastrophes so far.

 mk2LanderCabin= Mk2 Lander Can= This cozy capsule seats two, and is very lightweight. However, don't expect it to survive atmospheric entry or even a sneeze.

 mk3Cockpit_Shuttle= Mk3 Cockpit= A cockpit for those die hard explorers. Especially useful when transporting extra crew to a remote rock to save the day.

 probeCoreCube= Probodobodyne QBE= QBE is Probodobodyne's latest development in probe miniaturization. Despite it's diminutive size, the QBE is a fully-functional and incredibly lightweight command unit. All this goodness comes at a price however: The QBE's tiny enclosure means there is no room for internal reaction wheels, and battery capacity is pitiful at best. Despite all this, or perhaps because of it, many engineers have found it to be ideally suited for those 'optional return' missions.

 probeCoreHex= Probodobodyne HECS= The HECS core capabilities go far beyond its sleek, 6-sided futuristic casing. This probe core provides advanced guidance assistance technology, and comes fitted with internal reaction wheels and decently-sized batteries. Despite concerns that one day, autonomous spacecraft cores could become self-aware and turn against their creators, or even become very stubborn against opening pod bay doors, Probodobodyne insists that these unmanned AI-driven devices are the way of the future.

 probeCoreOcto= Probodobodyne OKTO= The OKTO is the next step in unmanned control technology. This small unit can not only receive and relay control, it also provides automatic stabilization assistance, just as a live pilot would. Also, its 8-sided stylistic design features lots of flat surfaces for attaching equipment.

 probeCoreOcto2= Probodobodyne OKTO2= The OKTO2 is far more than a flatter variant of the original OKTO. This new iteration of the ubiquitous 8-sided probe core features a much more advanced guidance system. This new model however, does not feature built-in reaction wheels and does requires more power to run, even on standby. Its internal battery supply is also very limited, being intended mainly to keep the Standby LEDs lit.

 roverBody= Probodobodyne RoveMate= A sturdy housing for a robust probe and battery system - no assembly required! Thought intended as the body for surface rovers, we've been told by our most day-dreaming of engineers that the possibilities are endless! While it has a Stability Assistance System, the RoveMate lacks reaction wheels so bring some along if you want to hold that attitude.

 probeStackLarge= RC-L01 Remote Guidance Unit= A larger version of the popular RGU system, developed in partnership with the Rockomax conglomerate.

 probeStackSmall= RC-001S Remote Guidance Unit= The STEADLER RGU core is one of the most complete command units available to date, featuring all the latest guidance systems, plus its own internal set of Reaction Wheels. STEADLER claims this is the closest one can get to a fully self-contained spacecraft. (Some assembly required. Spacecraft sold separately)

 probeCoreSphere= Probodobodyne Stayputnik= The Stayputnik offers the ultimate solution in crew safety. A lightweight sphere equipped with remote receivers and relay control input from the ground to the craft, it carries no crew at all, thus keeping them perfectly safe from all harm. This device does require electricity to operate however, and will cease to function if the power runs out. The built-in batteries should keep it going for about 10 minutes.

 fuelLine= FTX-2 External Fuel Duct= New breakthroughs at FLOOYD Dynamics have made the FTX Fuel Duct a reality. Altough criticized by some as being no more than 'a sewage pipe painted yellow', most agree that the yellow is a relatively nice color, and that fuel lines are indeed able to pump fuel from side-mounted fuel tanks. After the recall of the FTX-1 series, All FTX-2 lines have arrows painted on to indicate the fuel flow direction, so engineers can tell which way around they are supposed to go.

 strutConnector= EAS-4 Strut Connector= The Strut Connector is highly regarded by many spacecraft engineers as they help in constructing more stable spacecraft. Once both sides are connected, a structural beam is created to link both ends, allowing for sturdier (and heavier) construction.

 batteryBankLarge= Z-4K Rechargeable Battery Bank= New advances in surge control technology made The Z-4K, the largest battery pack ever put into production a reality. While Zaltonic admits intense electrical discharges can be really cool, shorting the Z-4K's contacts should probably be avoided.

 ionEngine= IX-6315 "Dawn" Electric Propulsion System= By emitting ionized xenon gas through a small thruster port, Dawn can produce incredibly efficient propulsion, but with a downside of very low thrust and high energy usage. According to ISP Electronics sales reps, the rumours of this engine being powered by "dark magic" are largely exaggerated.

This new model features the latest in thrust vectoring and compression technology and is designed to operate best at higher altitudes and speeds. The advanced turbo ramjet design bleeds air around the compressor at high speed allowing a far maximum speed than regular jet engines, so engineers from C7 Aerospace assured us all those leaks are intentional.

 smallRadialEngine= 24-77 "Twitch" Liquid Fuel Engine= Tiny engine! But very useful, good for craft where larger radial engines won't fit, or when you want more control in combination with large lifter engines.

 liquidEngineMini= 48-7S "Spark" Liquid Fuel Engine= The 48-7S may be small, but it packs quite a punch for its size. This little engine is a testament to how larger does not always mean more advanced, at least according to Rockomax's marketing department. The box it comes in is pretty cool, in any case.

 toroidalAerospike= T-1 Toroidal Aerospike "Dart" Liquid Fuel Engine= The Toroidal Aerospike is a huge breakthrough from C7 Aerospace. While heavier than previous models, with its heavy-duty exhaust nozzle, the Aerospike makes up for it with an efficient burning of fuel at all altitudes.

 microEngine= LV-1 "Ant" Liquid Fuel Engine= What is this, an engine for ants?

 radialEngineMini= LV-1R "Spider" Liquid Fuel Engine= Adapted to appease engineers who were outraged at the lack of control rocket engines usually provide, the radial mounted LV-1R offers an appealing solution: "Just add more".  Point away from face.

 liquidEngine3= LV-909 "Terrier" Liquid Fuel Engine= The 909 model was initially received with some skepticism by spacecraft engineers, as it defied the long-standing convention that "More Power!" is always better. Despite this, the 909 series has found its place in the spacecraft construction world, being particularly useful as a final stage and landing engine.

 nuclearEngine= LV-N "Nerv" Atomic Rocket Motor= Despite the big scary trefoil painted onto the side of this engine, its radioactive exhaust, and tendency to overheat, the LV-N Atomic Rocket Motor is harmless. Mostly. Note that the LV-N is the only LV series engine to run solely on Liquid Fuel - the future is glowing bright!

 liquidEngine= LV-T30 "Reliant" Liquid Fuel Engine= Although criticized by some due to their not insignificant use of so-called "pieces found lying about", the LV-T series engines have proven themselves as comparatively reliable. The T30 model boasts a failure and rattly bits ratio below the 50% mark, this has been considered a major improvement over previous models by engineers and LV-T enthusiasts.

 liquidEngine2= LV-T45 "Swivel" Liquid Fuel Engine= The LV-T45 engine was considered a breakthrough in the LV-T series due to its Thrust Vectoring feature. The LV-T45 can deflect its thrust to aid in craft control. All these added mechanics however, make for a slightly smaller and heavier engine in comparison with other LV-T models.

 liquidEngine1-2= RE-M3 "Mainsail" Liquid Fuel Engine= A monster of an engine for heavy lifting purposes, the Mainsail's power rivals that of entire small nations.

 radialLiquidEngine1-2= Mk-55 "Thud" Liquid Fuel Engine= After an intensive search for an engineer crazy enough to plan and build a revolutionary new engine type, researchers turned to renowned engineer Eumon Kerman, one of the top minds in the industry. He failed miserably at the job, and this is what we ended up with. Hey, at least it works well with other large (Rockomax) engines when you want more control. Sorry, no combo deals.

 liquidEngine2-2= RE-L10 "Poodle" Liquid Fuel Engine= A more reasonable engine for rough economic times, the Poodle engine doubles as a BBQ when at low power.

 engineLargeSkipper= RE-I5 "Skipper" Liquid Fuel Engine= The smaller sibling of the Mainsail, the Skipper's power rivals that of... large cities. Combining high thrust with reasonable efficiency, this engine excels when used as a mid-stage booster.

 SSME= S3 KS-25 "Vector" Liquid Fuel Engine= Kerbodyne's flagship engine, the KS-25 excels as a first stage engine through its high thrust-to-weight ratio and exceptional sea level efficiency. Kerbodyne engineers achieved this by running the engine in a staged combustion cycle and at extremely high chamber pressures. Special new alloys had to be invented to suppress the engine's tendency to become a bomb. The single version is designed with very durable components and high reusability, as well as higher gimbal range, but because of that is also heavier than its expendable counterpart used in first stage clusters.

 MassiveBooster= S1 SRB-KD25k "Kickback" Solid Fuel Booster= This super heavy booster is designed to be recovered after jettisoning. Once recovered, it is refurbished and refueled for another launch.

 miniJetEngine= J-20 "Juno" Basic Jet Engine= A small turbojet. Not very efficient, anemic thrust, but hey--it's cheap! And it's so cute...look at the little thing!

 omsEngine= O-10 "Puff" MonoPropellant Fuel Engine= When The O-10 Engine was first unveiled, it was regarded as one of those ideas that someone should have thought of a long time ago. This made most employees at Reaction Systems Ltd feel quite awkward, as they were particularly proud of having delivered this project on schedule for once. This Engine responds to main throttle controls, but it consumes MonoPropellant instead of a Fuel+Oxidizer mix.

 RAPIER= CR-7 R.A.P.I.E.R. Engine= The R.A.P.I.E.R. (Reactive Alternate-Propellant Intelligent Engine for Rockets) is a joint venture between C7 Aerospace and the Rockomax Conglomerate. Designed to fill a gap in the design requirements for sustainable single stage to orbit aircraft, this engine combines the best of rocket and air-breathing thrust technology.

 Size2LFB= LFB KR-1x2 "Twin-Boar" Liquid Fuel Engine= This liquid fuel booster system is a very purposeful piece of engineering. Instead of relying on single engines or solid rocket boosters, the KR-1x2 employs two modified KR-1 engine, fed by a built-in fuel system, as the source of its immense lifting power. All that self-contained goodness comes at the cost of not having a mounting point for its underside, and not being quite as efficient as dedicated engines. It also comes at quite a literal cost as well.

 Size3AdvancedEngine= Kerbodyne KR-2L+ "Rhino" Liquid Fuel Engine= This engine is Kerbodyne's first attempt at a highly advanced engine. The engineers couldn't get it to produce full efficiency at sea level without the engine exploding, so it was repurposed as an upper stage engine. The experience gained here with high efficiency has been repurposed for later models, which feature multiple combustion chambers at higher pressure (that don't go boom). This engine is optimized for lighting mid-flight, although it still provides respectable power at sea level.

 Size3EngineCluster= S3 KS-25x4 "Mammoth" Liquid Fuel Engine= Kerbodyne engineers got fed up with having to contend with overly complicated staging arrays for lifting heavy payloads, and decided instead to just build a truly enormous engine of the highest efficiency. Strapping together four of Kerbodyne's KS-25 rocket motors in a single assembly, they created the largest rocket engine in production anywhere, and each KS-25 has the highest chamber pressure--the reason for four small nozzles and combustion chambers, not one big one (those kept going boom). It's certainly got the power to match its size, and although it excels in its main role as a first-stage engine, the lack of structural hardpoints on its underside makes it quite less suitable for other purposes. Its price tag also seems to match its size, in fact.

 solidBooster1-1= BACC "Thumper" Solid Fuel Booster= Filled with a new, even more volatile fuel, the BACC offers semi-reliable performance at a good price.

 solidBooster= RT-10 "Hammer" Solid Fuel Booster= Packing a powerful punch for its size, The RT-10 is widely used in many space programs, whenever the need to save cash is greater than the need to keep astronauts alive.

 solidBooster_sm= RT-5 "Flea" Solid Fuel Booster= While considered by some to be little more than "a trash bin full o' boom", The RT-5 can be seen in use at many space programs, perhaps possibly because it is the only option for many space programs, but nevertheless, this small booster provides a nice kick to lift small payloads to considerable heights. Use with caution, though. Once lit, solid fuel motors cannot be put out until the fuel runs out.

 sepMotor1= Sepratron I= A small canister filled with what appears to be solid rocket fuel. Although not much of a step forward in terms of raw power, Kerbal Scientists have slowly warmed up to the Sepratron I's many uses, such as pushing things away. For best results, angle before use.

 vernierEngine= Vernor Engine= The VR-N1ER Veer-Governor, or "Vernor" Engine is an attitude control thruster. These motors are linked to RCS controls, but are powered by a Fuel+Oxidizer mix, making them significantly more powerful than MonoPropellant-powered RCS thrusters. They are fairly more bulky in comparison though, and feature only one nozzle facing outwards, although most agree that is an acceptable trade-off for the additional punch they pack.

 adapterMk3-Mk2= Mk3 to Mk2 Adapter= Our engineers insisted on a way to reuse Mk2 parts on the new Fuselage system. Manufacturing a streamlined adapter despite the considerable difference of the two cross sections required quite a radical design. It is often used as a slide on Take Your Kids to Work Day.

 adapterEngines= Mk3 Engine Mount= A structural mounting plate for rocket engines.

 adapterMk3-Size2= Mk3 to 2.5m Adapter= Perfectly pointy, carefully curved and devastatingly destructive, this Mk3 to 2.5m adapter can satisfy your wildest of dreams. Or it'll let you bridge the gaps between parts on your craft while giving you a bit of fuel... Your choice.

 adapterMk3-Size2Slant= Mk3 to 2.5m Adapter Slanted= Makes your craft hang in the air like bricks don't!

 adapterSize2-Mk2= 2.5m to Mk2 Adapter= When you can't decide between a rocket and a spaceplane, why not both?

 adapterSize2-Size1= C7 Brand Adapter - 2.5m to 1.25m= While the popular Rockomax Adapter has served its purpose fairly well over the years, C7 engineers thought they could do better. Improvements of this in-house product include an integrated fuel tank and a longer structural frame.

 adapterSize2-Size1Slant= C7 Brand Adapter Slanted - 2.5m to 1.25m= While the popular Rockomax Adapter has served its purpose fairly well over the years, C7 engineers thought they could do better. Improvements of this in-house product include an integrated fuel tank and a longer structural frame.

 adapterSize3-Mk3= Mk3 to 3.75m Adapter= An adapter for when your craft turns from a massive rocket into a gargantuan plane!

 fuelTank3-2= Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tank= The largest tank available from Rockomax, the Jumbo-64 holds a vast amount of fuel in a friendly orange insulated container. Contrary to popular belief, the Jumbo-64 is NOT orange flavored and should NOT be tasted.

 miniFuelTank= Oscar-B Fuel Tank= The Oscar-B Fuel Tank from Probodobodyne is a compact fuel container for small space probes, or a backup tank for other small spacecraft. Do not wash in cold water, or feed after midnight.

 fuelTankSmallFlat= FL-T100 Fuel Tank= The T100 is a miniature fuel tank made to be even more adorable than its bigger brother, the T200. Handle stoically and with care.

 fuelTankSmall= FL-T200 Fuel Tank= The T200 tank had some difficulty being accepted in the spacecraft engineering world, because most rocket builders had trouble overcoming their urges to squee at the "cute little fuel tank". This initial reaction was only put aside when the amount of fiery explosions in assembly areas became so high, strict guidelines were put in place to prohibit "teasing the fuel containers". The T200 Tank now is widely used in several space programs and does a remarkably good job, if assembled politely.

 fuelTank= FL-T400 Fuel Tank= The FL series was received as a substantial upgrade over previous fuel containers used in the Space Program, generally due to its ability to keep the fuel unexploded more often than not. Fuel tanks are useless if there isn't a Liquid Engine attached under it. They can also be stacked with other fuel tanks to increase the amount of fuel for the engine below.

 fuelTank_long= FL-T800 Fuel Tank= A stretched variant of the FL-T400, the FL-T800 holds twice the fuel in a slightly stronger container. The black stripes along the side make the rocket go faster, our engineers tell us.

 toroidalFuelTank= ROUND-8 Toroidal Fuel Tank= An unconventionally shaped (but undoubtedly handy) fuel tank.

 fuelTank2-2= Rockomax X200-16 Fuel Tank= After many, many studies, Rockomax engineers found that the space program does indeed have a use for a tank half the size of the X200-32. No refunds.

 fuelTank1-2= Rockomax X200-32 Fuel Tank= Developed after one J. Kerman complained that the fuel tanks available were 'way too small', the X200-32 holds a generous amount of fuel, for all your... fueling needs or something like that. Shut up, Rockomax hires rocket scientists, not writers.

 fuelTank4-2= Rockomax X200-8 Fuel Tank= A compact fuel tank, designed for small upper stages and landers. Rockomax takes no responsibility for the Dawton Kerman Aboveground Pool Company stickers on the inside because it totally is not a swimming pool frame we stole from their back lot.

 miniFuselage= Mk0 Liquid Fuel Fuselage= A small container for jet fuel.

 mk2_1m_Bicoupler= Mk2 Bicoupler= One engine is not enough? We got you covered!

 mk2_1m_AdapterLong= Mk2 to 1.25m Adapter Long= A generic Mk1 to Mk2 adapter that was left to dry a bit too long and stretched out.

 mk3FuselageLFO_50= Mk3 Rocket Fuel Fuselage= For that rare moment when your fuel needs are less than ludicrous.

 mk3FuselageLF_100= Mk3 Liquid Fuel Fuselage Long= C7 Aerospace Division had issues piping the fuel from the refinery, so they brought the refinery tanks to us! It sounded like they muttered "Good luck.." as they dropped off these parts.

 mk3FuselageLF_25= Mk3 Liquid Fuel Fuselage Short= For the economically minded aerospace designer, who is building a massive plane...

 mk3FuselageLF_50= Mk3 Liquid Fuel Fuselage= For when your fuel needs are only 1/4 as enormous.

 mk3FuselageMONO= Mk3 Monopropellant Tank= The reaction to when the reaction control system doesn't have enough control in the system; more monopropellant!

 RCSTank1-2= FL-R1 RCS Fuel Tank= A larger-scale version of the standard RCS fuel tank.

 rcsTankMini= FL-R10 RCS Fuel Tank= The FL-R10 is a miniature RCS tank for small probes and low volume monopropellant storage.

 RCSFuelTank= FL-R25 RCS Fuel Tank= These fuel tanks store monopropellant for RCS thrusters. New advances in plumbing technology made it possible to route RCS lines to any point in the ship. So unlike liquid fuel tanks, RCS Fuel tanks can be placed anywhere.

 radialRCSTank= Stratus-V Roundified Monopropellant Tank= Despite its fanciful name, the Stratus-V is quite simple - a small, radially attachable RCS tank.

 rcsTankRadialLong= Stratus-V Cylindrified Monopropellant Tank= After years of research and development, the Stratus corporation has developed a revolutionary upgrade to their Stratus-V fuel tank line. Cylinders. This tank holds a moderate supply of monopropellant for RCS thrusters.

 Size3LargeTank= Kerbodyne S3-14400 Tank= When nobody believed in (or even asked for) an even larger fuel tank than the already enormous S3-7200, Kerbodyne stepped up with the sanity-defying S3-14400 model. Carrying fully twice as much fuel as before, this fuel tank may just pack enough propellant to justify its proportionately enormous cost.

 Size3MediumTank= Kerbodyne S3-7200 Tank= Kerbodyne's signature heavy fuel tank. Designed to be used with their advanced rocket engines.

 Size3SmallTank= Kerbodyne S3-3600 Tank= A half-capacity version of Kerbodyne's iconic fuel tank, for not quite exactly half the cost.

 xenonTank= PB-X150 Xenon Container= Although most of the Probodobodyne staff couldn't pronounce "Xenon", when told how to say it correctly, they all agreed it sounded super-cool - and everything possible should be done so it could be used as a fuel, no matter the cost.

 xenonTankLarge= PB-X750 Xenon Container= Although most of the Probodobodyne staff couldn't pronounce "Xenon", when told how to say it correctly, they all agreed it sounded super-cool - and everything possible should be done so it could be used as a fuel, no matter the cost.

 xenonTankRadial= PB-X50R Xenon Container= The X50R is a small-volume Xenon container, heralded by engineers for being ideally suited for small ion-driven spacecraft, and also for having thoroughly disproved management in their notion that a smaller fuel tank would make the fuel cheaper.

 InfraredTelescope= SENTINEL Infrared Telescope= The Sentinel Space Telescope uses infrared light to detect celestial bodies, such as asteroids, that may pose a risk to Kerbin.

 HECS2_ProbeCore= Probodobodyne HECS2= A larger probe core based on the popular HECS design. With integrated battery banks, specialized flight controls, and a built-in reaction wheel, the HECS2 is a suitable probe core for more advanced satellites.

 HighGainAntenna= Communotron HG-55= The Communotron HG-55 high gain antenna allows for blazingly fast directional data transmission, and was originally designed for deep space probes. Please note that Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics is not liable for any damages that might result from prolonged exposure to RF radiation.

 LgRadialSolarPanel= OX-STAT-XL Photovoltaic Panels= A larger version of the OX-STAT, the XL version features a larger surface area than its smaller cousin while retaining the cost and weight benefits of a static solar panel.

 PotatoRoid= A potato like rock= Big ole, rock like thing.

 flag=wait=wait

 kerbalEVA=wait=wait

 kerbalEVAfemale=wait=wait

 FuelCell= Fuel Cell= A small fuel cell that allows fuel and oxidizer to be converted into energy.  Handy for those places where a solar panel will not do.  Also handy for re-heating snacks.

 FuelCellArray= Fuel Cell Array= Why have just one fuel cell when you can have six?  The fuel cell array is ideal for situations where you need a large source of reliable power.  Like the smaller fuel cells, this array operates by converting fuel and oxidizer into energy.

 ISRU= Convert-O-Tron 250= This mobile processing plant can take raw materials containing even trace amounts of oxygen and hydrogen, and crack them into useful fuel products.  When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.  These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating.  Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat.

 LargeTank= Large Holding Tank= A large tank that can be used for storing raw materials.  Not to be used as a bouncy castle.

 MiniDrill= Drill-O-Matic Junior' Mining Excavator= A smaller version of the popular Drill-O-Matic, this drill is designed to help extract valuable resources from the crust of planets and asteroids.  Unlike it's larger cousin, this smaller model is only suitable for ore concentrations in excess of 2.5%.  When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.  These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating.  Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat.

 MiniISRU= Convert-O-Tron 125= A smaller version of Kerbodyne's mobile processing plant, this module can take raw materials containing even trace amounts of oxygen and hydrogen, and crack them into useful fuel products.  When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.  While this smaller model is lighter than it's bigger cousin, it is less efficient, and not designed for long-term operations.  These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating.  Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat.

 OrbitalScanner= M4435 Narrow-Band Scanner= Ideal for surveying potential landing sites, this scanner provides detailed information about the planet or moon that it orbits, though this data is limited to the spot directly below the scanner.

 RadialDrill= Drill-O-Matic' Mining Excavator= Designed to help extract valuable resources from the crust of planets and asteroids, the Drill-O-Matic uses a rotary drill combined with an internal transfer auger to pull crushed regolith into holding tanks for later processing.  When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.  These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating.  Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat.

 sensorAtmosphere= Atmospheric Fluid Spectro-Variometer= A device for performing accurate fluid spectro-variometry scans of the surrounding atmosphere. Despite some criticism claiming that fluid spectro-variometry isn't a real science, Kerbal scientists seem to all agree that the data it provides is definitely interesting. Warranty void if exposed to air.

 GooExperiment= Mystery GooT Containment Unit\u0020= This unit was something one of our engineers came upon while dumpster divin-- Erm, while researching alternative applications for existing technologies. It's a sealed container which appears to be filled with a strange-looking substance. We couldn't reach in or break the canister open, but watching how the Goo behaves when subjected to different situations could be very educational.

 Large_Crewed_Lab= Mobile Processing Lab MPL-LG-2= No longer are you limited to research facilities only on Kerbin!  With the Mobile Processing Lab, you can conduct long-term experiments and ongoing research with the data you collect in the field.

 science_module= SC-9001 Science Jr.= The SC-9001 is a cutting edge, self contained laboratory. Have you ever wondered what happens to something in zero G? Or, have you ever pondered the truly meaningful questions? Such as what would happen if I exposed this to the rigors of stellar radiation and unforgiving vacuum? Comes with complimentary notepad. Recommended for ages 4-8. Small parts inside make it not suitable for small children.

 ScienceBox= Experiment Storage Unit= After discovering that old snack boxes were also really effective at storing mystery goo and data tapes, Kerbal scientists created the Experiment Storage Unit to help Kerbalnauts bring their valuable science back to Kerbin, while avoiding the hazards of reentry, rough landings, and Jeb's piloting skills.

 sensorAccelerometer= Double-C Seismic Accelerometer= This device contains an extremely sensitive acceleration sensor, which when properly settled on a firm surface, will detect and record accurate seismic activity data. The accelerometer will still function while flying, so the Double-C can also be used to measure accelerations during flight. Warranty void if shaken or exposed to vacuum.

 sensorBarometer= PresMat Barometer= A device for measuring the local atmospheric pressure. Warranty void if exposed to air.

 sensorGravimeter= GRAVMAX Negative Gravioli Detector= A device for capturing and measuring the elusive Negative Gravioli Particle, used for determining the precise strength of gravitational fields. Warranty void if used to detect Positive Gravioli Particles.

 sensorThermometer= 2HOT Thermometer= This thermometer is definetely not a store-bought model with some wires stuck to it. Warranty void if an engineer admits it's actually a store-bought model with some wires stuck to it.

 adapterLargeSmallBi= TVR-200L Stack Bi-Adapter= After realizing 'larger circles' wasn't a very patentable concept, O.M.B. Enterprises rolled out a new line of ingenious multi-connector adapters to fit Rockomax sized parts. Lawsuit still pending. Converts a single 2.5m stack into two 1.25m stacks.

 adapterLargeSmallQuad= TVR-400L Stack Quad-Adapter= After realizing 'larger circles' wasn't a very patentable concept, O.M.B.

 MK1Fuselage= Mk1 Liquid Fuel Fuselage= A standard fuselage that carries fuel for spaceplanes. This one is chock-full of jet fuel. Not as resistant as its counterparts, but jet fuel is more efficient than the other fuels, without mentioning lighter.

 MK1IntakeFuselage= Mk1 Diverterless Supersonic Intake= This version of the Mk1 Fuselage module carries only a bit of fuel, but is fitted with a streamlined air intake. It consists of a "bump" and a forward-swept inlet cowl. This eliminates the need for a Splitter plate, while compressing the air to slow it down from supersonic to subsonic speeds. DSIs can be used to replace the intake ramp and inlet cone, which are more complex, heavy and expensive.

 Mk1FuselageStructural= Structural Fuselage= A standard fuselage. Carries no fuel; is there merely as a structural element. As such, it's lighter and more solid due to reinforcements.

 size3Decoupler= TR-38-D= Originally designed to separate buildings that were stuck together, O.M.B has repurposed these explosive bolts for use in separating stacks of massive rockets.

 Size3to2Adapter= Kerbodyne ADTP-2-3= This adapter is used to bridge between Kerbodyne and Rockomax rocket bodies.

 stationHub= Rockomax HubMax Multi-Point Connector= When it was unveiled at the 3rd annual Rockets & Explosions festival, the HubMax Multi-Point Connector caused several patrons to die of shock on the spot. 'All my life I thought rocket parts could be placed one way - up! But Rockomax today has shattered that notion' said one survivor, who asked to remain anonymous. Needless to say, this part may very well herald a revolution in construction technologies. Docking ports sold separately.

 structuralIBeam2= M-Beam 200 I-Beam= Handcrafted by Dinkelstein himself, the M-Beam 200 works great for making rockets and skyscrapers alike.

 structuralIBeam3= M-Beam 200 I-Beam Pocket Edition= Handcrafted by Dinkelstein himself, the M-Beam 200 works great for making rockets and skyscrapers alike. This one's half as long as the normal version, for building smaller skyscrapers and/or rockets.

 radialDecoupler= TT-38K Radial Decoupler= The TT-38K Radial Decoupler, like most other decouplers, is equipped with a (hopefully) small explosive charge, that will sever the structural linkage between itself and whatever it's connected to.

 radialDecoupler2= TT-70 Radial Decoupler= The TT-70 Radial Decoupler is an extension of the TT-38K decoupler, with a large truss structure for greater space between mounting points.

 stackSeparator= TR-18D Stack Separator= Unlike Decouplers, Separators jettison everything attached to them. This new technology was very well received by rocket engineers everywhere. Not bad for something that started out as a failure for a controlled explosive bolt prototype.

 stackSeparatorMini= TR-2C Stack Separator= Similarly to the TR-18D, the TR-2C is a utility for slicing a rocket into two halves, but now in a more compact size. The manual says the explosive content is just enough to eject anything attached to the unit in a safe, controlled manner. The delivery guy did have a full bomb suit on though, so try not to drop it.

 stackSeparatorBig= TR-XL Stack Separator= The TR-XL Stack Separator is the largest available from O.M.B, designed for slicing the largest of rockets in twain.
